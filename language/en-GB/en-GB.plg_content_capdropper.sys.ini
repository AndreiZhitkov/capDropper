HELP_TEXT="<h5>Settings</h5><br/><strong>Enable capDropper</strong> Use this switch to stop automatic caps insertion without stopping to filter out the switch tags if any were used within the article body.<br/><strong>Drop caps automatically</strong> Drop caps automatically in all articles unless switched off with the {dropcaps off} tag (useful if you need drop caps in most but perhaps not all articles), or drop capitals manually into articles with the {dropcaps on} tag (useful if you need drop caps in only a few articles).<br/><strong>Components to exclude</strong> Typically, there will be components, with which you would never want to use drop caps. Exclude such components from automatic insertion by entering their code names. use commas for separation. The default entries are for Contacts, K2 and Akeeba Release System<br/><stong>Use in overview pages</strong> If enabled, the capicals will display in blog layouts. Otherwise they will only be auto-inserted in article views. This behavier can be overridden manualy by swith tags as follows. If set to automatic insertion, use <pre>{capdropper off}</pre> in articles to switch the plugin off for that article. If automatic insertion is not set, use <pre>{capdropper on}</pre> to switch the plugin on per article. Insert the tag in the intro part (before <strong>Read more...</strong> line) to control the capital insertion on overview pages, i.e. in category blogs.<br/><strong>CSS styling to use</strong> You may choose to add the necessary CSS styles to your template CSS file. In this case select <em>Template</em>. Alternatively, the drop cap can be styled in the settings below.<br/><strong>CSS class name</strong> If the drop capital is styled in the site template, make sure you enter the CSS class to match it exactly. Any name can be used for default operation as long as it does not conflict with other CSS class names.<br/><strong>Default CSS styling</strong> Enter the CSS parameters here. Follow the example set by the defaults. To move the drop cap vertically, decrease or increase the first padding number. To change the color, add something like 'color:fuchsia;'.<br/><small>Copyright Andrei Zhitkov (c) 2015, all rights reserved.
